# HPI Data Analysis and Forecasting with ARIMA

This project focuses on analyzing housing price index (HPI) data and forecasting future trends using the AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model.

## Overview

The project contains various data files, Jupyter notebooks, and documents that detail the analysis, methodology, and results of the project.

### Files

- `HPI_master.csv`: A CSV file containing the HPI dataset provided by the Federal Housing Financy Agency.
- `Housing.csv`: A CSV file containing housing-related data.
- `Sale_Prices_State.csv`: A CSV file containing state-level sale price data sourced from Zillow.
- `state_statistics_for_download.xls`: An Excel file containing state-level pricing information by quarter.

### Jupyter Notebooks

- `PR 1 Milestone 2 Code GreenertJ.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing the code for the project.
- `PR 1 Milestone 2 GreenertJ.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing the analysis and results for Milestone 2 of the project.

### Documents

- `PR 1 Milestone 1 GreenertJ.docx`: A Word document detailing the first milestone of the project.
- `PR 1 Milestone 1 GreenertJ.pdf`: A PDF version of the first milestone document.
- `PR 1 Milestone 2 GreenertJ.pdf`: A PDF document containing the analysis and results for Milestone 2 of the project.
- `PR 1 Milestone 3 GreenertJ.pdf`: A PDF document detailing the third milestone of the project.
- `PR 1 Milestone 3 GreenertJ.pptx`: A PowerPoint presentation summarizing the third milestone of the project.

## Getting Started

To explore the project, open the Jupyter notebooks in a compatible environment, such as [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), and run the code cells in sequence.

Make sure to have the necessary Python packages installed, including `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `statsmodels`. You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib statsmodels
```
