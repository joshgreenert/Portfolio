# Java Servlet Project

This project demonstrates the creation and deployment of a Java Servlet application. The application showcases the use of Java Servlets, JavaBeans, JSP, and HTML/CSS for creating dynamic web content.

## Overview

The project contains the following files:

### Web Application Archive (WAR) File

- `joshgreenertWeek8.war`: A precompiled web application archive file, ready for deployment on a Java web server.

### Java Server Pages (JSP) Files

- `form2.jsp`: A JSP file that processes form data and utilizes JavaBeans.
- `javabean.html`: An HTML file demonstrating the use of JavaBeans with a form.
- `joshgreenertFormPost4.jsp`: A JSP file that processes form data and demonstrates basic form handling in a Java Servlet application.
- `joshgreenertFormPost5.jsp`: A JSP file that processes form data and demonstrates advanced form handling and validation in a Java Servlet application.

### HTML Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file, serving as the entry point for the application.

### CSS Files

- `styles.css`: A CSS file containing styles for the application.

### Directory Structure

- `WEB-INF`: A folder containing the web application's deployment descriptor (web.xml) and additional configuration files.
- `src`: A folder containing the Java source code for the application.

## Deployment

To deploy the application, ensure that you have a compatible Java web server, such as [Apache Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/), and follow the server's instructions for deploying WAR files.

Alternatively, you can compile the source code in the `src` folder and manually deploy the application by creating a new web application directory on your server and copying the contents of this project into it.
