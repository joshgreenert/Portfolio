# Customer Churn Predictions

This project is a machine learning model that predicts customer churn in the telecommunications and banking industries. The model is built using two separate datasets and is designed to identify which features are most influential in churn reduction.

## Overview

The project is built in Python and utilizes the following machine learning libraries:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest Regression

The data is preprocessed to remove any missing values, and feature engineering is performed to extract relevant features from the dataset. The data is then split into training and testing sets, and a variety of machine learning models are trained and evaluated to identify the most effective algorithm. Finally, the model with the highest performance is selected and used to make predictions on new data.

## Datasets Used

- Telecommunications Dataset: Contains information on telecommunications customers and whether or not they churned.
- Banking Dataset: Contains information on bank customers and whether or not they closed their accounts.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest Regression

## Setup

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/joshgreenert/Portfolio.git
2. Install the necessary packages using pip: pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
3. Load the datasets into the project directory
4. Run the script

## Example Usage

The model can be used to predict customer churn in both the telecommunications and banking industries. By identifying the key factors that lead to churn, businesses can take proactive steps to retain customers and improve their bottom line.
