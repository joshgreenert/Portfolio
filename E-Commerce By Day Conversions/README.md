# E-commerce by Day Conversions

This project analyzes e-commerce conversion rates by day, providing insights to improve marketing strategies and user experience. The data is preprocessed and fed into four different classifiers to predict which factors have the greatest impact on conversion rates.

## Overview

The project is built in Python and utilizes the following machine learning libraries:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Support Vector Classifier
- Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier

The data is preprocessed to remove any missing values, and feature engineering is performed to extract relevant features from the dataset. The data is then split into training and testing sets, and four different classifiers are trained and evaluated to identify the most effective algorithm. Finally, the model with the highest performance is selected and used to make predictions on new data.

## Dataset Used

- E-commerce Dataset: Contains information on user behavior on an e-commerce website, including whether or not they made a purchase.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Support Vector Classifier
- Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier

## Setup

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/joshgreenert/Portfolio.git
2. Install the necessary packages using pip: pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
3. Load the dataset into the project directory
4. Run the script

## Example Usage

The model can be used to identify which factors have the greatest impact on conversion rates, allowing e-commerce websites to improve their marketing strategies and user experience.
