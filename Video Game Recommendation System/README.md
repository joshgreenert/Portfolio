# Video Game Recommendation System

This project uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and TF-IDF models in Python to predict the next 5 games a user may enjoy based on their input. The project is built in Python and utilizes the Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) libraries along with a Kaggle dataset containing millions of Steam reviews.

## Overview

The project is built in Python and utilizes the following libraries:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)

The KNN model is trained on a dataset of video game names and user reviews, and the TF-IDF model is used to analyze the reviews and predict which games a user may enjoy based on their input. The resulting recommendations are displayed to the user.

## Dataset Used

- Steam Video Game Dataset: Contains video game titles and user reviews.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/joshgreenert/Portfolio.git
2. Install the necessary packages using pip: pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk
3. Load the dataset into the project directory.
4. Run the script

## Example Usage

The model can be used to predict which video games a user may enjoy based on their input, providing recommendations for further gaming experiences.
