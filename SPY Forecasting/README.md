# SPY Forecasting

This project uses the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model in Python to predict future values of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) using historical data. The resulting predictions are displayed using Matplotlib.

## Overview

The project is built in Python and utilizes the following libraries:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow
- Keras

The historical data is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets. The LSTM model is then trained on the data and used to make predictions on new data. The results are displayed using Matplotlib.

## Dataset Used

- SPY Historical Data: Contains historical values of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY).

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow
- Keras

## Setup

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/joshgreenert/Portfolio.git
2. Install the necessary packages using pip: pip install pandas numpy matplotlib tensorflow keras
3. Load the dataset into the project directory.
4. Run the script

## Example Usage

The model can be used to make predictions on future values of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), allowing investors to make informed decisions about buying and selling.
